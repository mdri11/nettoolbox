## 🚀 Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.6 or higher
- pip package manager
- Administrative privileges (for packet sniffing)

### System Dependencies

#### Ubuntu/Debian
```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install nmap python3-dev python3-pip
# Optional: wireshark-common (for enhanced packet analysis)
sudo apt install wireshark-common
```

#### CentOS/RHEL/Fedora
```bash
sudo yum install nmap python3-devel python3-pip
# or for newer versions:
sudo dnf install nmap python3-devel python3-pip
```

#### macOS
```bash
# Using Homebrew
brew install nmap python3

# Using MacPorts
sudo port install nmap python3
```

#### Windows
1. Install Python 3.6+ from [python.org](https://python.org)
2. Download Nmap from [nmap.org](https://nmap.org/download.html)
3. Install Visual C++ Build Tools (if needed)

### Python Package Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/mdri11/nettoolbox.git
cd nettoolbox

# Install Python dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Alternative: Install in virtual environment (recommended)
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## 🎯 Quick Start

### Basic Usage
```bash
# Run the main application
python main.py

# With specific Python version
python3 main.py
```

### Example Commands
The application provides an interactive menu system, but here are some key operations:

1. **Network Scanning**: Choose option 1 from main menu
2. **Web Security Testing**: Choose option 2 from main menu  
3. **Packet Analysis**: Choose option 3 from main menu
4. **Monitoring Setup**: Choose option 5 from main menu

## 🔧 Configuration

### Logging Configuration
Logs are automatically saved to the `logs/` directory with timestamps. Log levels can be configured in the settings menu.

### Results Export
All scan results are automatically saved in JSON format to the `results/` directory. Additional export formats (CSV, TXT) are available through the export menu.

### Custom Wordlists
Place custom wordlists in the project directory and specify them during directory brute forcing operations.

## 🛡️ Security Considerations

### Legal and Ethical Usage
- **Authorization Required**: Only use against networks and systems you own or have explicit permission to test
- **Responsible Disclosure**: Report vulnerabilities through proper channels
- **Compliance**: Ensure compliance with local laws and regulations
- **Rate Limiting**: Use appropriate delays to avoid overwhelming target systems

### Best Practices
- Run scans during maintenance windows when possible
- Document all testing activities
- Use minimal necessary scan intensities
- Respect robot.txt and terms of service
- Keep scanning tools updated

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### "Permission denied" for packet sniffing
```bash
# Linux: Run with sudo or add user to wireshark group
sudo python main.py
# or
sudo usermod -a -G wireshark $USER
```

#### "nmap not found" error
- Ensure nmap is installed and in system PATH
- Try reinstalling nmap package
- Verify installation with `nmap --version`

#### Import errors for scapy
```bash
# Install with specific options
pip install --no-binary :all: scapy
# or
pip install scapy[complete]
```

#### Windows-specific issues
- Install Microsoft Visual C++ Build Tools
- Use Command Prompt as Administrator
- Disable Windows Firewall temporarily for testing

### Performance Optimization
- Adjust thread counts for your system capabilities
- Use targeted scans instead of broad sweeps
- Enable result caching for repeated operations
- Monitor system resources during intensive scans
